# Terms of use

**Last Updated: February 20, 2026**

Please read these Terms of use ("Terms") carefully before using the Peppool Wallet browser extension ("the App"). By installing, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

## 1. Non-Custodial Service
Peppool Wallet is a non-custodial software interface. 
- We do not have access to your private keys, secret phrases (seed phrases), or funds.
- We do not store your passwords or any sensitive data on our servers.
- You are solely responsible for the safety and backup of your secret phrase. **If you lose your secret phrase, Peppool Wallet cannot recover it, and your funds will be permanently lost.**

## 2. No Liability
Peppool Wallet is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties of any kind. 
- We are not responsible for any loss of funds, including but not limited to those caused by user error (e.g., forgotten passwords, incorrect addresses), software bugs, or malicious activity (e.g., phishing, malware).
- We do not control the Pepecoin (PEP) network and are not responsible for its performance, downtime, or transaction delays.

## 3. Compliance & Risk
- You are responsible for complying with the laws of your jurisdiction regarding the use of cryptocurrency.
- Cryptocurrency investments and transactions carry significant risk. You acknowledge that Peppool Wallet is not a financial advisor.

## 4. Blockchain Fees
All transactions on the Pepecoin network require a network fee ("Ribbits"). These fees are paid to miners, not to Peppool Wallet. You are responsible for ensuring your wallet has sufficient funds to cover these fees.

## 5. Third-Party Services
The App may integrate with third-party APIs (e.g., peppool.space) or services. We are not responsible for the accuracy or availability of these external services.

## 6. Privacy
Your use of the App is also governed by our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md). We do not collect or store your personal data or transaction history.

## 7. Modifications
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App following any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
